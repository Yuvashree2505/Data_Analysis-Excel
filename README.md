Exploration of HR Attrition Analysis Dashboard project:

1. **Overall Attrition**: This KPI provides an overview of the number of employees who have left the organization.

2. **Active Rate**: The proportion of employees who are currently active in the organization compared to the total number of employees.

3. **High Performance and Low Performance Ratio**: Able to look the number of high-performing employees to low-performing employees who have left the organization. This helps in understanding if there's a correlation between performance and attrition.

4. **Age & Gender Distribution**: Analyze the distribution of attrition across different age groups and genders to identify any trends or disparities.

5. **Education Level of Exiting Employees**: Determine the education level of employees who have left the organization to assess if there's any correlation between education and attrition.

6. **Attrition by Job Role**: Calculate the attrition rate for each job role or department to identify areas with higher rate of employees.

7. **Work Distance Impact**: Analyze the impact of work distance on attrition by comparing the attrition rates for employees with varying commute distances.

8. **Attrition by Gender**: Calculate the attrition rate separately for male and female employees to understand if there are any gender-related factors influencing turnover.

9. **Business Travel Impact**: Assess the impact of business travel on attrition by comparing the attrition rates for employees who frequently travel for work versus those who do not.

10. **Retention Effectiveness by Department**: Measure the effectiveness of retention strategies by department or team by comparing attrition rates over time.

These Exploration provide valuable insights into different aspects of attrition within the organization, enabling HR professionals and management to pinpoint areas for improvement and implement targeted retention strategies.
